# Windows BSOD Error Page

### 😵What's this?

This is a BSOD page project that mimics Windows 10 or Windows 11, and that's all.

### 😱What's the use?

If you are using a hosting management panel like aaPanel or 1Panel, setting its default page to this might make the tedious task of website management a bit more interesting (maybe?).

### 🧐How to use it?

I provide the default 404_NOT_FOUND page, you just need to change the HTML title and the bottom error code to suit your needs.
In addition, a default initial page for PHP is provided, which can be modified as needed.

### 😊Regarding QR codes

I used a white background and set the QR code to be transparent, allowing the underlying background color to show through. This approach is very efficient.

### 😥Supported languages

I only know some English and Chinese; for other languages, you might need to modify them yourself.
